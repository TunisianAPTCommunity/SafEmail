## Spear-Phishing and Advanced Persistent Threat Campaigns

Spear-phishing is the most prevalent delivery method for advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks. Today’s cyber criminals launch APT attacks with sophisticated malware and sustained, multi-vector and multi-stage campaigns to achieve a particular objective. In a typical spear-phishing attack, a specially crafted email is sent to specific individuals from a target organization. “APT campaigns frequently make use of spear-phishing tactics because they are essential to get high-ranking targets to open phishing emails,” the TrendLabs APT Research Team noted in the Trend Micro white paper.

Spear-phishing may be defined as highly targeted phishing aimed at specific individuals or groups within an organization. Spear-phishing makes use of information about a target to make attacks more specific and personal to the target. Spear-phishing is a targeted email scam with the sole purpose of obtaining unauthorized access to sensitive data.
